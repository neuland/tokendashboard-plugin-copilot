# auto-updater — which runs as vscode — unable to write to its own package directory,
# failing with "no write permission to npm prefix" (~/.claude/.last-update-result.json
# shows status "no_permissions").

# Seed ~/.claude.json once from the host's file (mounted read-only at a separate path,
# not bind-mounted onto ~/.claude.json itself) so Claude Code skips the theme/subscription
# prompts on every fresh container. A one-time copy, not a live sync: Claude Code writes
# this file via atomic rename (temp + rename), which detaches a single-file bind mount from
# the host inode, leaving the container with stale content until a rebuild. Copying once on
# creation avoids that without keeping host and container in sync afterwards.
